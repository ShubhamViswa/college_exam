### **1. What is HTML? Explain its use. Also explain the structure of an HTML document.**

1. **HTML Definition**:
   - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the primary language used to create web pages.

2. **Purpose**:
   - It is a markup language that structures content on a webpage.

3. **Content Structuring**:
   - HTML uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.

4. **Functionality**:
   - HTML tells the web browser how to display and organize content in a meaningful way.

#### **Uses of HTML:**
1. **Website Structure**: HTML allows developers to organize content on a webpage using elements like headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), paragraphs (`<p>`), and links (`<a>`).
2. **Multimedia Integration**: HTML enables the inclusion of images, videos, and audio on a webpage using tags like `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>`.
3. **Links and Navigation**: HTML provides the ability to add hyperlinks (`<a>`) that connect different web pages, allowing for seamless navigation between them.
4. **Forms for Data Collection**: HTML forms (`<form>`) are used to collect user input. These forms contain various input elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.
5. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Proper HTML structure, including meta tags, headers, and alt attributes, can improve a webpage’s visibility in search engines.

#### **Structure of an HTML Document:**
An HTML document is made up of several key components, organized in a specific structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  <!-- Declaration defining document type -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- Root element of the page -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- Character encoding -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- For responsive design -->
    <title>Page Title</title> <!-- Title of the document shown in the browser tab -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Heading</h1> <!-- Main heading -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- Paragraph text -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Link to Example</a> <!-- Hyperlink -->
</body>
</html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and ensures that the web browser renders the page in standards mode.
- **`<html>`**: The root element that wraps the entire HTML document.
- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and character set. It does not display on the page itself but affects how the page behaves.
- **`<body>`**: This is the content section where all visible elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images are placed.

### **2. What is a Socket? Explain TCP/IP based server socket with an example.**

A **Socket** is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. It provides a way for processes to communicate with each other over a network (either within the same machine or between different machines). Sockets are crucial in client-server communication, allowing data to be sent and received.

#### **TCP/IP-based Server Socket:**
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the backbone of most network communication. A **TCP/IP server socket** allows the server to listen for incoming client connections and then exchange data with the connected clients. The server and client communicate by sending messages back and forth over the established TCP/IP connection.

**Key Steps for TCP/IP Communication:**
1. **Server Side**:
   - **Create a Socket**: The server creates a socket using the `socket()` system call.
   - **Bind to Address and Port**: The server binds the socket to a specific IP address and port.
   - **Listen for Connections**: The server listens for incoming client connections using the `listen()` call.
   - **Accept Connections**: When a client connects, the server accepts the connection with `accept()`.
   - **Data Exchange**: The server can send and receive data using the socket.

2. **Client Side**:
   - **Create a Socket**: The client creates a socket and attempts to connect to the server using the `connect()` call.
   - **Data Exchange**: Once connected, the client can send data to the server and receive responses.

**Java Example:**
Here’s how the server and client would look in **Java**:

#### **Server Side (Java):**
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a server socket that listens on port 12345
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(12345);
            System.out.println("Server is waiting for a connection...");

            // Accept the incoming client connection
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Connection established with: " + clientSocket.getInetAddress());

            // Create input and output streams for communication with the client
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

            // Read the message from the client
            String message = reader.readLine();
            System.out.println("Received from client: " + message);

            // Send a response back to the client
            writer.println("Hello, client!");

            // Close the streams and socket
            reader.close();
            writer.close();
            clientSocket.close();
            serverSocket.close();

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Client Side (Java):**
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a socket and connect to the server on localhost and port 12345
            Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 12345);

            // Create input and output streams for communication with the server
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

            // Send a message to the server
            writer.println("Hello, server!");

            // Read the response from the server
            String response = reader.readLine();
            System.out.println("Received from server: " + response);

            // Close the streams and socket
            reader.close();
            writer.close();
            socket.close();

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

- The **server** listens for connections on port `12345` and exchanges messages with the client.
- The **client** connects to the server, sends a message, and receives a response.

### **3. How many types of forms are available in HTML? Design an order-entry form that contains all the form controls and elements.**

In HTML, forms are used to collect user input. They are an essential part of websites where user interaction is required, such as filling out surveys, signing up for services, or submitting feedback.

#### **Types of Forms in HTML:**
1. **Text Inputs**: Used for entering text.
2. **Password Inputs**: Used for entering passwords with characters hidden.
3. **Radio Buttons**: Used to select one option from a list.
4. **Checkboxes**: Used to select multiple options.
5. **Select Dropdown**: Used to select a single or multiple options from a list.
6. **Text Area**: Used for multi-line text input.
7. **File Upload**: Allows users to upload files.
8. **Submit Button**: Submits the form data.
9. **Reset Button**: Resets the form to its default values.
10. **Hidden Inputs**: Used for passing data that isn't visible to the user.

#### **Order-Entry Form Example:**

This form collects information such as user name, email, product selection, quantity, delivery option, comments, and payment method.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Order Entry Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Order Entry Form</h1>
    <form action="/submit_order" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Full Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br><br>

        <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>

        <label for="phone">Phone Number:</label>
        <input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone"><br><br>

        <label for="product">Product:</label>
        <select id="product" name="product">
            <option value="laptop">Laptop</option>
            <option value="phone">Phone</option>
            <option value="tablet">Tablet</option>
        </select><br><br>

        <label for="quantity">Quantity:</label>
        <input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10" value="1"><br><br>

        <label for="delivery">Delivery Option:</label><br>
        <input type="radio" id="standard" name="delivery" value="standard" checked>
        <label for="standard">Standard Shipping</label><br>
        <input type="radio" id="express" name="delivery" value="express">
        <label for="express">Express Shipping</label><br><br>

        <label for="comments">Comments:</label><br>
        <textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea><br><br>

        <label for="payment">Payment Method:</label><br>
        <input type="radio" id="credit" name="payment" value="credit">
        <label for="credit">Credit Card</label><br>
        <input type="radio" id="paypal" name="payment" value="paypal">
        <label for="paypal">PayPal</label><br><br>

        <input type="submit" value="Place Order">
        <input type="reset" value="Reset Form">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

This **order-entry form** contains:
- **Text Inputs** for name, email, and phone.
- **Select Dropdown** for selecting a product.
- **Number Input** for quantity.
- **Radio Buttons** for delivery options and payment method.
- **Text Area** for comments.
- **Submit and Reset Buttons** to submit or reset the form.

### **4. What is JDBC? Write different types of Java drivers available for database connectivity. What are the steps of database connectivity in Java?**

**JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** is a Java API that enables Java applications to interact with databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to relational databases, executing queries, and retrieving results. JDBC allows developers to write database applications in Java.

#### **Types of JDBC Drivers:**
1. **JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver (Type 1)**: This driver translates Java calls into ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) calls, which are then passed to the database. This is an outdated driver and is no longer widely used.
2. **Native-API Driver (Type 2)**: This driver uses database-specific client libraries to connect to the database. It requires native code for the specific database, such as Oracle or MySQL client libraries.
3. **Network Protocol Driver (Type 3)**: This driver uses a middleware server that translates database calls into a specific database protocol. It doesn’t require any client-side software but requires a network connection.
4. **Thin Driver (Type 4)**: This is a pure Java driver that directly communicates with the database using a database-specific protocol, without the need for native code or middleware. It is the most commonly used JDBC driver.

#### **Steps for Database Connectivity in Java:**
1. **Load the JDBC Driver**: You must load the database driver class using `Class.forName()` method.
2. **Establish a Connection**: Use `DriverManager.getConnection()` to establish a connection to the database using the URL, username, and password.
3. **Create a Statement**: Create a `Statement` object using `Connection.createStatement()`, which will allow you to execute SQL queries.
4. **Execute a Query**: Execute a query using methods like `executeQuery()` for SELECT queries or `executeUpdate()` for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries.
5. **Process the Result**: Use `ResultSet` to process the data returned by the query.
6. **Close Resources**: Always close the `ResultSet`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects to release the resources.

**Example of Database Connectivity in Java:**
```java
import java.sql.*;

public class JDBCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Load the driver
            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
            
            // Establish a connection
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "root", "password");

            // Create a statement
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            
            // Execute a query
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");

            // Process the result
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println("ID: " + rs.getInt("id"));
                System.out.println("Name: " + rs.getString("name"));
            }
            
            // Close resources
            rs.close();
            stmt.close();
            conn.close();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### **5. What is a String Buffer? How does it differ from a string? Give three ways to create a string object.**

A **StringBuffer** is a mutable sequence of characters, meaning that the content of a StringBuffer object can be modified after it is created. Unlike **String**, which is immutable (its value cannot be changed once created), **StringBuffer** allows appending, inserting, or modifying its content without creating new objects.

#### **Difference between String and StringBuffer:**
- **Immutability**: 
   - **String** is immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.
   - **StringBuffer** is mutable, allowing modification of its contents without creating new objects.
  
- **Performance**: 
   - **String** operations like concatenation involve creating a new object, which can lead to performance overhead, especially in loops.
   - **StringBuffer** is more efficient for frequent modifications, as it doesn't create new objects for each operation.

#### **Ways to Create a String Object:**
1. **Using a String Literal**:
   - Example: `String str = "Hello";`
   - This creates a String object using a literal. If the string already exists in the pool, it reuses it.
  
2. **Using the `new` Keyword**:
   - Example: `String str = new String("Hello");`
   - This creates a new String object on the heap, even if the string literal already exists in the string pool.
  
3. **Using the `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` (For Efficient Concatenation)**:
   - Example: `String str = new StringBuilder("Hello").toString();`
   - This converts a `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` object to a String.

### **6. What do you mean by data types and Wrapper Class? Explain the various primitive data types supported in Java.**

In Java, **data types** define the type of data a variable can hold, such as integers, characters, or floating-point numbers. Java has **primitive data types** and **wrapper classes**.

#### **Primitive Data Types**:
Java supports the following primitive data types:
1. **byte**: 8-bit signed integer. Range: -128 to 127.
2. **short**: 16-bit signed integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
3. **int**: 32-bit signed integer. Range: -2^31 to 2^31-1.
4. **long**: 64-bit signed integer. Range: -2^63 to 2^63-1.
5. **float**: 32-bit floating-point number. Range: approximately ±3.40282347E+38F.
6. **double**: 64-bit floating-point number. Range: approximately ±1.7976931348623157E+308.
7. **char**: 16-bit Unicode character. Range: 0 to 65,535.
8. **boolean**: Represents two possible values: `true` or `false`.

#### **Wrapper Classes**:
Each primitive data type has a corresponding **wrapper class** in Java, which allows primitive types to be treated as objects. Wrapper classes are part of the `java.lang` package.
1. **Byte**: Wraps a `byte` value.
2. **Short**: Wraps a `short` value.
3. **Integer**: Wraps an `int` value.
4. **Long**: Wraps a `long` value.
5. **Float**: Wraps a `float` value.
6. **Double**: Wraps a `double` value.
7. **Character**: Wraps a `char` value.
8. **Boolean**: Wraps a `boolean` value.

Wrapper classes provide utility methods for converting between types and also support null values, which primitive types do not.

### **7. Write short notes on:**

### **7.1 Exception Handling in Java.**

**Exception Handling** in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring that the flow of the program can be controlled even when an exception occurs. It helps to maintain the normal flow of the application.

#### **Key Concepts**:
1. **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program, like trying to divide by zero, accessing an array element that does not exist, etc.
2. **Try-Catch Block**: 
   - **`try` block**: Contains the code that might throw an exception.
   - **`catch` block**: Catches and handles the exception thrown in the try block.
3. **Finally Block**: It is optional and contains code that is always executed after the try-catch block, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
4. **Throw**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
5. **Throws**: Used in method signatures to indicate that a method may throw exceptions.

**Example:**
```java
public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // Division by zero
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This will always execute.");
        }
    }
}
```

### **7.2 Linking image to a web page.**

To **link an image** to a webpage in HTML, you use the `<a>` tag (anchor tag) wrapped around the `<img>` tag. The `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag specifies the link, and the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag specifies the image source.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" width="300" height="200">
</a>
```

In this example:
- When the user clicks on the image, they are redirected to `https://www.example.com`.
- The `alt` attribute provides an alternative text if the image is not available.

### **7.3 Inheritance in Java.**

**Inheritance** is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the parent (superclass) and child (subclass) classes.

#### **Types of Inheritance**:
1. **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from another class.
2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from another class, and the derived class can be further inherited by another class.
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.
4. **Multiple Inheritance**: In Java, multiple inheritance (where a class can inherit from more than one class) is not allowed directly, but it can be achieved using interfaces.

**Example of Inheritance:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class TestInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal();
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        
        animal.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        dog.sound();    // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Dog` class inherits the `sound` method from the `Animal` class but overrides it to provide its


### **What is inheritance in java explain its type if we need to extend nore than one class how it works explain with example**

## **Inheritance in Java**  

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (child/subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and fields) of another class (parent/superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes.

### **Types of Inheritance in Java**
Java supports the following types of inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**  
   - A child class inherits from a single parent class.  
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Parent {
         void display() {
             System.out.println("This is Parent class");
         }
     }
     class Child extends Parent {
         void show() {
             System.out.println("This is Child class");
         }
     }
     public class Test {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Child obj = new Child();
             obj.display(); // Inherited method
             obj.show();    // Child's own method
         }
     }
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     This is Parent class  
     This is Child class  
     ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**  
   - A child class inherits from a parent class, and another class further inherits from the child class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Grandparent {
         void showGrandparent() {
             System.out.println("This is Grandparent class");
         }
     }
     class Parent extends Grandparent {
         void showParent() {
             System.out.println("This is Parent class");
         }
     }
     class Child extends Parent {
         void showChild() {
             System.out.println("This is Child class");
         }
     }
     public class Test {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Child obj = new Child();
             obj.showGrandparent();
             obj.showParent();
             obj.showChild();
         }
     }
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     This is Grandparent class  
     This is Parent class  
     This is Child class  
     ```

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**  
   - Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Parent {
         void showParent() {
             System.out.println("This is Parent class");
         }
     }
     class Child1 extends Parent {
         void showChild1() {
             System.out.println("This is Child1 class");
         }
     }
     class Child2 extends Parent {
         void showChild2() {
             System.out.println("This is Child2 class");
         }
     }
     public class Test {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Child1 obj1 = new Child1();
             obj1.showParent();
             obj1.showChild1();

             Child2 obj2 = new Child2();
             obj2.showParent();
             obj2.showChild2();
         }
     }
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     This is Parent class  
     This is Child1 class  
     This is Parent class  
     This is Child2 class  
     ```

4. **Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces in Java)**  
   - Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity issues.
   - However, it can be achieved using **interfaces**.

### **How to Extend More Than One Class in Java?**
Java does **not** support **multiple inheritance** using **classes** directly. Instead, **interfaces** can be used to achieve this.

#### **Example of Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces:**
```java
interface A {
    void showA();
}

interface B {
    void showB();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void showA() {
        System.out.println("This is method from Interface A");
    }

    public void showB() {
        System.out.println("This is method from Interface B");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.showA();
        obj.showB();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
This is method from Interface A  
This is method from Interface B  
```

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Java supports single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance with classes.**
- **Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes but allows it through interfaces.**
- **Interfaces allow a class to implement multiple behaviors, making Java more flexible and avoiding the diamond problem.**

Would you like me to provide a real-life analogy for better understanding?
